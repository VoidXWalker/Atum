# Atum (Random and set seed autoresetter)

Mod to automatically reset random and set seeds


## Usage

Press the golden boots button on the main menu to start the world resetting mode.

To reset, simply leave the world (either the normal save and quit or the fast reset button).

To exit the resetting mode, press the "Stop Resets & Quit" button at the bottom left of the options menu.

----------

To change the seed that gets reset or to change the difficulty simply shift click on the golden boots.

An empty seed will result in the mod resetting random seeds.

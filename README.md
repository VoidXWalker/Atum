# Atum (Random and set seed autoresetter)
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/voidxwalker)

Mod to automatically reset random and set seeds

## Usage

Press the golden boots button on the main menu to start the world resetting mode.

To reset, simply leave the world (either the normal save and quit or the fast reset button).

To exit the resetting mode, press the "Stop Resets & Quit" button at the bottom left of the options menu.

Adds a hotkey (by default F6) that when pressed will reset as soon as possible no matter what (even works outside a world and during chunk generation).

----------

To change the seed that gets reset, change the difficulty, change the generator type (like superflat), change generate structures or change bonus chest simply shift-click on the golden boots.

An empty seed will result in the mod resetting random seeds. 

## Info and Compatibility

This mod is valid for speedruns on http://speedrun.com/mc and its category extensions.

Just replace Duncan's autoresetter jar with the newest release of this one, attempts and difficulty files are compatible.

Closet Witch's Fast Reset mod is compatible (https://github.com/jan-leila/FastReset/releases) and will make resetting with the hotkey more efficient.

My World Preview Mod is compatible (https://github.com/VoidXWalker/WorldPreview) and will make resetting with the hotkey more efficient.

Note for resource pack creators: the "Stop Resets & Quit" button can be changed by customizing menu.stop_resets in your language file if you like.
